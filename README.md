SmartPark – Parking Owner Dashboard (React)

This project is a React-based Parking Owner Dashboard designed to help parking lot owners manage their business efficiently.
It provides features like parking lot management, live bookings, revenue analytics, slot monitoring, notifications, and owner profile management, all built using React functional components, hooks, and Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first UI.

The application currently uses mock data and state-based navigation to simulate real-world parking operations and is structured to be easily integrated with backend APIs in the future.
